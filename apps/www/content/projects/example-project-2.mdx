## Project Overview

This AI-powered data analysis tool helps users extract insights from complex datasets using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. It features an intuitive interface and powerful backend processing.

## Key Features

- **Automated Analysis**: Machine learning models automatically detect patterns
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time charts and graphs
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and prepare data with AI assistance
- **Export Reports**: Generate comprehensive analysis reports

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- FastAPI for high-performance API
- TensorFlow for machine learning models
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Celery for background tasks

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
