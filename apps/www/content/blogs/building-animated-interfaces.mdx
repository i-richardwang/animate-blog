## Building Animated Interfaces with Motion

Animation can transform a good interface into a great one. In this post, we'll explore how to build smooth, performant animations using Motion and Animate UI components.

### The Power of Motion

Motion (formerly Framer Motion) is a production-ready animation library for React that makes it easy to create smooth, performant animations. All Animate UI components are built with Motion at their core.

### Animation Principles

When building animated interfaces, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Purpose**: Every animation should serve a purpose - guiding attention, providing feedback, or showing relationships
2. **Performance**: Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) whenever possible
3. **Accessibility**: Respect user preferences with `prefers-reduced-motion`
4. **Subtlety**: Less is often more - subtle animations feel more polished

### Example: Animated Tabs

Our Tabs component showcases these principles perfectly:

```tsx
import {
  Tabs,
  TabsList,
  TabsTrigger,
  TabsContents,
  TabsContent,
} from '@/components/animate-ui/components/animate/tabs';

export function AnimatedTabs() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="overview">
      <TabsList>
        <TabsTrigger value="overview">Overview</TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="features">Features</TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="pricing">Pricing</TabsTrigger>
      </TabsList>
      <TabsContents>
        <TabsContent value="overview">
          Overview content with smooth transitions
        </TabsContent>
        <TabsContent value="features">
          Feature highlights with animations
        </TabsContent>
        <TabsContent value="pricing">
          Pricing information
        </TabsContent>
      </TabsContents>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

### Performance Tips

- Use `layout` animations for smooth position changes
- Leverage Motion's `AnimatePresence` for exit animations
- Optimize with `willChange` for complex animations
- Test on lower-end devices
