When I decided to build my personal website, I wanted something more than just a basic blog template. I needed a space that could serve as both a digital garden for my notes and a showcase for my work—all while looking beautiful and feeling modern.

That's when I discovered [Animate UI](https://animate-ui.com).

## Why Animate UI?

Animate UI is an open-source React component distribution built with Tailwind CSS and Motion. What caught my attention wasn't just the gorgeous animations—it was the philosophy behind it.

Unlike typical npm packages, Animate UI follows the "copy and customize" approach popularized by shadcn/ui. You don't install it as a dependency; you copy the source code directly into your project. This means **complete control** over every component, every animation, and every design decision.

The original project is designed as a component library documentation site, showcasing animated primitives, components, and icons. But I saw potential for something different.

## The Transformation Journey

### From Component Library to Digital Garden

The beauty of Animate UI's architecture is its flexibility. The site is built with:

- **Next.js 15** for the framework
- **Fumadocs** for documentation structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Motion** (Framer Motion) for animations

I realized this tech stack was perfect for a personal site. The documentation structure could easily become a knowledge base, the component showcase could transform into a blog, and those beautiful animations would make the whole experience delightful.

### The Core Changes

I approached the transformation with a simple philosophy: **preserve the original structure, customize the content**.

**Navigation & Structure**: The original site had sections for Components, Primitives, and Icons. I replaced these with my content pillars: AI Exploration, Data Science, and Development. But I didn't stop there—I also added a dedicated Blog section, something the original project didn't have. The beauty is that Fumadocs already supported blog collections; I just needed to wire it up and add it to the navigation.

**Homepage Evolution**: The hero section's animated logo and text effects were too good to lose. I kept all the animations but changed the messaging from "Animate your UI" to "Learning, Building, Sharing"—a better fit for a personal site. The CTA buttons now point to "Explore Notes" and "Read Blog" instead of component documentation.

**Content Architecture**: Instead of component documentation, I created a dual content system:

- **Knowledge Base** (`/docs`): A three-tier structure with main modules (AI, Data Science, Development), sub-categories, and detailed notes
- **Blog** (`/blog`): For sharing thoughts, tutorials, and project updates—more narrative, less structured than the knowledge base

The existing meta.json system for organizing docs worked beautifully for both the structured notes and the chronological blog posts.

### Design Decisions

One thing I was careful about: **maintaining the original design language**. The animations, the spacing, the typography—these were all thoughtfully crafted. Rather than reinventing the wheel, I focused on adapting the content to fit the existing aesthetic.

The result? A personal site that feels cohesive, professional, and uniquely animated.

## Making It Your Own

If you want to use this as a starting point for your own site, here's what you'll need to customize. I've designed the changes to be straightforward—mostly configuration and content updates.

### Site Identity

The first step is making it yours—branding, metadata, and links.

**Update site metadata** in `apps/www/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    template: '%s - Your Name',
    default: 'Your Name - Your Tagline',
  },
  description: 'Your site description...',
  // Update keywords, authors, publisher, etc.
};
```

**Replace the domain** in both `layout.tsx` and `lib/json-ld.ts`:

```tsx
// Find and replace
url: 'https://richardwang.me';
// with
url: 'https://yourdomain.com';
```

**Update social links** - GitHub and Twitter/X appear in multiple files:

- `components/header.tsx`
- `components/docs/nav.tsx`
- `components/footer.tsx`
- `app/docs/layout.tsx`

Just search for `i-richardwang` and `richard2wang` and replace with your handles.

### Visual Identity

**Logo**: If you want to keep the animated SVG logo (recommended—it's beautiful!), you'll need to create your text as an SVG path.

The easiest way:

1. Open Figma, create your text
2. Select font and size
3. Right-click → "Outline Stroke"
4. Export as SVG
5. Copy the path data into `components/logo.tsx`

The logo component uses Motion to animate the path drawing—super smooth effect.

**Favicon**: Replace the files in `/public`:

- `favicon-16x16.png`
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `og-image.png` (for social sharing)

### Content & Navigation

**Homepage hero** (`components/hero.tsx`):

```tsx
const TITLE = 'Your Tagline Here';

// Update the badge/announcement
<Link href="/blog">Latest thoughts and notes</Link>

// Update the description
<p>Your personal introduction...</p>

// Update CTA buttons
<Link href="/docs">Explore Notes</Link>
<Link href="/blog">Read Blog</Link>
```

**Header navigation** (`components/docs/nav.tsx`):

```tsx
export const NAV_ITEMS = [
  { title: 'Your Section 1', url: '/docs/section-1' },
  { title: 'Your Section 2', url: '/docs/section-2' },
  { title: 'Blog', url: '/blog' },
];
```

**Sidebar tabs** (`lib/sidebar.tsx`):

```tsx
export const SIDEBAR_TABS = [
  {
    title: 'Your Section',
    description: <TabsDescription title="Description" count={0} />,
    icon: <YourIcon />,
    url: '/docs/your-section',
  },
  // Add more sections for your knowledge base
];
```

**Guide links** in sidebar (`app/layout.config.tsx`):

```tsx
links: [
  {
    type: 'separator',
    name: 'Guide',
    icon: <BookOpen />,
  },
  {
    text: 'Your Link',
    url: '/your-url',
  },
];
```

### Content Organization

The site supports two types of content, each with its own purpose:

**Knowledge Base** (`/content/docs/`): Structured, hierarchical notes organized by topic. Each section needs:

- `index.mdx` - landing page with Cards to sub-sections
- `meta.json` - defines navigation structure and ordering
- Individual `.mdx` files for detailed notes

Example `meta.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Section",
  "pages": ["---Category Name---", "category/article-1", "category/article-2"]
}
```

**Blog** (`/content/blogs/`): Time-based posts for sharing thoughts, tutorials, and updates. Each post is a standalone `.mdx` file with frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Your Post Title
description: Brief description
date: 2024-01-15
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
---
```

This dual structure gives you flexibility—use `/docs` for evergreen, structured content and `/blog` for timely, narrative pieces.

### A Note on Code Preservation

Throughout the codebase, you'll see comments like:

```tsx
// Original ... (commented out for upstream sync)
```

I've kept all the original Animate UI code in comments. This makes it easy to:

- See what changed
- Sync with upstream updates
- Reference the original implementation

Feel free to keep this pattern or remove the comments once you're comfortable with the codebase.

## The Result

What started as a component library is now a personal digital space. The animations that once showcased UI components now guide visitors through my thoughts and projects. The documentation structure that explained primitives now organizes my knowledge.

And the best part? Because everything is customizable at the source level, I can continue to evolve it. Want to add a new section? Create a new module. Need a different layout? Modify the components. The possibilities are endless.

If you build something with this, I'd love to see it. Feel free to reach out and share what you create!

## Credits

Huge thanks to the [Animate UI](https://animate-ui.com) team for building such an incredible foundation. The component library, the animations, the documentation structure—it's all open source and beautifully crafted.

If you haven't checked out Animate UI for your projects, I highly recommend it. And if you're building a personal site, well, you know where to start now.
