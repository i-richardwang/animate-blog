## Welcome to Animate UI

We're excited to introduce **Animate UI** - a fully animated, open-source component distribution built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Motion.

### What is Animate UI?

Animate UI is not a traditional NPM library. Instead, it's an open collection of components you can copy, modify, and customize directly in your codebase. This approach gives you maximum flexibility without wrapper overhead or styling workarounds.

### Key Features

- **Open source & copy-first**: Direct access to source code so you can adapt components to your design system
- **Animation-first, powered by Motion**: Consistent, composable motion patterns that make interfaces feel modern and engaging
- **Performance & accessibility**: Sensible defaults that keep your site fast and accessible
- **Style-agnostic**: Not prescriptive about look and feel; baseline styles are minimal and easy to restyle
- **Multi-primitive support**: Support for Radix UI, Base UI, and Headless UI

### Getting Started

Installation is simple. Just run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

Then install any component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://animate-ui.com/r/components-animate-tabs
```

### What's Next?

We're constantly adding new components and improving existing ones. Check out our [roadmap](/docs/roadmap) to see what's coming next.

Join us in building beautiful, animated interfaces!
