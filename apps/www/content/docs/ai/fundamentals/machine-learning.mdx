Introduction to machine learning concepts and practical applications.

## Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning

Training models with labeled data to make predictions.

### Unsupervised Learning

Finding patterns in unlabeled data.

### Reinforcement Learning

Learning through interaction with an environment.

## Getting Started
