Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data that make machine learning algorithms work better.

## Techniques

### Feature Creation

Combining or transforming existing features.

### Feature Selection

Choosing the most relevant features.

### Feature Scaling

Normalizing and standardizing features.

### Encoding

Converting categorical variables to numerical format.

## Coming Soon

Advanced techniques and practical examples.
